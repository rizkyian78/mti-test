Alice and Bob each created one problem for Glints Test. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty

If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.

Example

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 2, 1]
For elements *0*, Bob is awarded a point because a[0] .
For the equal elements a[1] and b[1], no points are earned.
Finally, for elements 2, a[2] > b[2] so Alice receives a point.
The return is Draw.

if Alice Has more Score than Bob Then Alice won with score intact and vice versa
